Getting To Philosophy
====================

Description
-----------

Python script which repeatedly requests random pages from Wikipedia, and generates a graph of their path (if one exists) back to the Philosophy Wikipedia page.

This project is a fork of [David Muller's getting_to_philosophy](https://github.com/DavidMuller/getting_to_philosophy), allowing me to re-use his code for getting the first non-italisicised link in a Wikipedia page.

Inspiration
-----------
